Software-defined networking (SDN) technology enables for dynamic, programmatically effective network design to boost network performance and monitoring, which makes network administration more like cloud computing than traditional network management. SDN is meant to address the static design of traditional networks. SDN separates the routing mechanism from the forwarding of network packets (data plane) in an effort to consolidate network intelligence into a single network component (control plane). The control plane, which is thought of as the central processing unit (CPU) of the SDN network and contains all of the network's intelligence, is made up of one or more controllers. The main issue with SDN is that centralization has drawbacks for security, scalability, and flexibility on its own.

The OpenFlow protocol, which is used to decide the flow of network packets across network switches by communicating remotely with network plane elements, has been connected to SDN regularly since it was first introduced in 2011. However, as of 2012, private systems have begun use the expression. These include the Open Network Environment from Cisco Systems and the Nicira network virtualization technology.
